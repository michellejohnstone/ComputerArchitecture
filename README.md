Experiments in low-level language programming for Computer Architecture at Mills College, Fall 2016: 

* MIPSALU.qpf
  * Implemented Overflow check for adding and subtracting 32 bit integers in Verilog. 

* MIPSALU_Waveform.vwf 
  * Runs a functional simulation of MIPSALU code and visually presents inputs and outputs.
