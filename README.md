# ComputerArchitecture
Low-level language programming exercises for Computer Architecture at Mills College, Fall 2016:

* MIPSALU.qpf
  * Implemented Overflow check for adding and subtracting 32 bit integers in Verilog.

* mux4Variable.v
  * Implemented a variable-width 4-way multiplexer on top of 3 2-way multiplexers.

* .vwf files
  * Run functional simulations of code and visually present inputs and outputs.

* control_unit.v, cpu.v, instruction_memory.v
  * Created top-level design entity (cpu.v) and the control unit, implementing a simple microprocessor.
  * Coded fibonacci sequence in assembly language and machine language.
